## Test the model through feasibility analysis
1. What are the demographics, trends, patterns of change, and life-cycle stage of the industry?
  - The demographic would mostly be geared towards milennials and also middle-aged recruiters. As far as patterns of change, as the age of social media gets more prominent, people are becomming more connected and our application fits that changing atmosphere. 
2. What are the barriers to entry and are there any barriers you can set up?
  - Public acceptance is a barrier to entry, it will be difficult at first to get our users to trust the application. Furthermore, marketing will be a needed feature to get the idea to the public and to get the public to realize the potential helpfulness. 
3. What is the status of technology and R&amp;D expenditures, and what is the level of innovation?
  - Modest level innovation in regards to technology through the use of existing applications, we are the platform to connect them all together. We would most likely have to hire a software developer to work on our mobile platform, and develop better ways to maintain and design our code base.
4. What are typical profit margins in the industry?
  - TBD
5. Who are the opinion leaders in the industry and how do they affect the industry?
  - Recruiters and bloggers that could potentially influence the userbase in assessing the viability or "worth" of using our application.       
6. What are distributors, competitors, retailers, and others saying about the industry?
  - The industry of interconnectivity is closely related with the social media industry in the hopes of connecting the world digitally. As we progress into the future, the world will be more influenced by technology and social media is always going to be prevalent.
7. What are the demographics of the target market?
  - 16-25 would be the target market for social media interconnectivity. As far as the more business focused side of our application, the target market would be college-age students and also users seeking jobs in addition to recruiters. Also, we plan on advertising the idea to grade schools and colleges as a way to connect students and get them more involved.
8. What is the profile of the first customer? Are there other potential customers?
  - A group of recruiters at a job fair. Furthermore, a college student looking to expand his social media network. 
9. How have you approached customers to learn about their needs? 
  - We've approached friends and family to discuss what they would like to see in an application that aids in connecting people digitally. 
10. Who are your competitors, and how are you differentiated from them? Product/Service (Chapter 6) 
  - LinkedIn could be a potential competitor, but instead of solely online interconnectivity, our application is focused on physical meeting and also we have competition with the business card industry. 
11. What are the features and benefits of the product or service?
  - Ease of use to connect people digitally through social media and also contact. The convenience is key because everything is in one place for a person's information. The benefit of recruiters to have streamline information to work with and the benefit of not having to physically carry information such as a resume and other resources.
12. What product development tasks must be undertaken to achieve a marketable product, and what is the timeline for completion and the associated costs?
  - The development of the application must happen, to have a type of demo for potential customers and/or schools to enjoy the idea of our product. As far as timeline for completion, a month of full time work. Marketing for recruitment of schools to be on board with the idea could be a time investment. As far as associated costs, the develop would have to be paid at an hourly rate. 
13. What is the window of opportunity for this product?
  - The window of opportunity would probably be in the next year with how fast mobile applications are being developed.    
14. Is there potential for intellectual property rights?
  - We will be utilizing other industries as a platform for ours, we would have to avoid some of their IP but I don't see us having any potential rights.
15. How is the product or service differentiated from others in the market? Founding Team (Chapter 7) 
  - There is no real one place for all your social media and an easy way of connecting others (through QC scanning and/or NFC)
16. What experience and expertise does the team have?
  - We have the expertise of being milennials that know the potential importance of connecting with peers. Furthermore, basic knowledge of supply chain, economics, management, and software development. 
17. What are the gaps and how will you fill them? Financial Needs Assessment (Chapters 8) 
  - As for software we don't have experience utilizing QC scanning, bluetooth, and NFC in a phone. Also, we don't have experience with marketing and advertisement.  
18. What are your startup capital requirements?
  - Around $1,000 for advertisement purposes, printing, etc.
19. What are your working capital requirements?
  - Around $3,000 for paying for development work and other unforseen costs. 
20. What are your fixed cost requirements?
  - There is no real fixed cost because we don't have a physical location.
21. How long will it take to achieve a positive cash flow from the revenues generated?
  - With personalization being an opportunity to get schools on board, I see revenue being generated in about 3-6 months as we get people on board.  
22. What is the break-even point for the business?
  - The break even point would be equal to the startup costs, potentially.
23. What are your funding requirements? Timeline and milestones?
  - The first pitch could be a public reveal, and continued advertising with the potential for server costs would increase funding requirements. We're looking at around a $3,000 yearly but the load of people could go up and down.
