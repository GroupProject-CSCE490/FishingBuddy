## Summary ???
- Closing statement, questions, you meet someone in public and you want to connect with them for future experiences, you find out that you both have the app, then you can touch phones and each person can choose what they would like to share (enabling Facebook, disabling LinkedIn), then the information is in one place. The ability to filter by date/location is a possibility.
